# Animals Sample App 🐩

> _What could be more fun than having a pet? Making your own!_

## Overview

1. Clone the project
2. Run `bun install` or `npm install`
3. Run `bun run test` or `npm run test`
4. Run `bun run dev` or `npm run dev`

## The Brief

- Users should be able to name animals
- Users should be able to have multiple animals of different types
- Playing with animals makes them happy
- Feeding animals makes them less hungry
- Resting animals makes them less sleepy
- Animals start "neutral" on all metrics
- Happiness should decrease over time
- Hunger should increase over time
- Sleepiness should increase over time
- Happiness should decrease faster when sleep or hunger is full
- Each animal type should have metrics which increase/decrease at different rates

## The Technical Bit

- The main functionality and business logic should be tested
- Use of 3rd party libraries is permitted but should be kept to a minimum - we wan't to see what you are capable of!
